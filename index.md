## Bad Hypothesis Contest

This ICLR 2021 social will be organised in the format of a contest. Each participant will prepare/improvise a 5 minutes stand-up, where they present a bad hypothesis (that is clearly ridiculous and untrue) and provide “evidence” (spurious correlations) that supports this hypothesis. 

For instance, the hypothesis could be “The generator and discriminator are tired of being adversarial and just want to be friends” and the supporting evidence could be “GAN collapse”. We will provide a list of hypotheses for the contestants to choose from to encourage participation, however everyone is welcomed to propose their own bad hypothesis. The organisers will be judges to the event, and we will select the winner and give out prizes based on vote among all participants.

Our format is inspired by [BAHfest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9v7v79mAlvKCrjrJvj-Fww)

### Examples
* Generators and discriminators are tired of being adversarial and just want to be friends
  * Evidence: GAN collapse 


### Participate
If you want to participate, we'd love to have you present your bad hypothesis! You can either present one of the example hypotheses, or even better, come up with your own.
Just fill out [this Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14SDaYf-RpLpaDHPIgELCYekV37rX0x-XGpviSucfdbA/viewform?edit_requested=true) and we'll select a few for presentation at the social.
